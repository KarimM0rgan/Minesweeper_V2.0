# üß© MineSweeper Game V2.0!

# üéÆ About the Game
Minesweeper is a classic game where a grid has normal tiles and uncovered mines. The objective of the game is to uncover all tiles and flag all mines. If the player presses a mine, they lose. If they uncover all safe tiles, they win. More about the game [here](https://www.instructables.com/How-to-play-minesweeper/).

# üöß Implementation

Unlike Minesweeper V1.0 that has only one class, Minesweeper V2.0 has 5 classes: `Main`, `MinesweeperGUI`, `MinesweeperGame`, `Tile`, and `Flag`! 

`Java Swing Library` was utilized to create the classic GUI needed for the game. 

instead of explaining what every class does in general, I figured it would be better to add in-line comments to explain what every method, variable, boolean, or statement does.
# üîÆ New Features
1. $Flagging$: The flagging feature was added, where the player could right-click the tile and get it flagged.
2. $Timer$: A timer was added at the top panel that starts the moment the player presses a tile and stops when either the player uncovers all the clean tiles or when then press a mine.
3. $Restart Button$: A restart button was added at the top panel, where the user can press right after the game ends to keep playing.
4. $GUI$: The `Java Swing Library` was used to create a wonderful GUI that made the game play smoother and similar to the classic game.
5. $Cool Emojis$: Restart button emoji updates the emoji according to status. 
# üèéÔ∏è Progress

I believe I have made it through 95% of the game. Those 5% were deducted because I couldn't add the choice for the player to customize the number of tiles and mines or choose difficulty. In my defence, I DID implement the custom and difficulty choosing features and the whole GUI was messed up and tried tracing through the code and changing it multiple times but all in vain.

In exchange for not adding the difficulty choosing feature, I added a restart button for the player to rerun the game and play another round! 

# üî£ Comments

I enjoyed making the game. From learning about the logic of a game that I have never played before to learning stuff that enabled me to create one of the things that embarked my initial interest in Computer Science - a video game.

That would be a start to many more games or applications in the future!!!
